    abstract = {Recent advances in software testing allow automatic derivation of
    tests that reach almost any desired point in the source code. There
    is, however, a fundamental problem with the general idea of
    targeting one distinct test coverage goal at a time: Coverage goals
    are neither independent of each other, nor is test generation for
    any particular coverage goal guaranteed to succeed.
    We present EvoSuite, a search-based approach that optimizes
    whole test suites towards satisfying a coverage criterion,
    rather than generating distinct test cases directed towards distinct
    coverage goals.
    Evaluated on five open source libraries and an industrial case
    study, we show that EvoSuite achieves up to 18 times the coverage
    of a traditional approach targeting single branches, with up to 44\%
    smaller test suites.}
