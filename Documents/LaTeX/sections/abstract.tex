In this thesis, we define two experiments (\ie, a baseline experiment and its replication) and analyze their results. The goal of these experiments is  to compare Test-Driven Development (\tdd), an incremental approach to software development where tests are written before production code, with a traditional way of coding where production code is written before tests (\ie, \notdd). \tdd and \notdd have been contrasted in the context of the implementation of embedded systems (\ess). The goals of the replication study are to validate the results of the baseline experiment and to generalize them to a different and more real setting. The most remarkable differences concern the implementation task and the experimental procedure: as for the task, we asked the participants to implement a larger and more complex \es in the replicated experiment; as for the procedure, the implementation task was not accomplished in the replicated experiment under controlled conditions and the developed \es (\ie, the result of such task) was then deployed and tested on a real software/hardware environment.  
%Participants in the experiments were final year Students in Computer Science enrolled to an \es course. 
The results obtained by an aggregated analysis of data gathered from both the baseline and the replicated experiments suggest that there is not a significant difference between \tdd and \notdd on: productivity, number of written tests, a... . On the other hand we observed a significant  on: ... When analyzing experiments individually, we observed that ...
