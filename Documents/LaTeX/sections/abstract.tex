In this thesis, we investigate the effectiveness of Test-Driven Development (TDD) techniques for the development of Embedded Systems (ESs), by presenting the results of two experiments (i.e., a baseline experiment and its replication). The goal of these experiments is to compare Test-Driven Development (TDD), an incremental approach to software development where tests are written before production code, with a development approach in which a developer first writes production code and then tests it. The two development approaches have been compared in the context of the development of embedded systems (ESs). The obtained results suggest that ...
