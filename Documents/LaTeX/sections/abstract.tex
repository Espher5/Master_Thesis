This thesis investigates the applicability of Test-Driven Development (TDD) for embedded systems development. Embedded systems are computer systems that perform a specific function and are integrated into larger products; these systems have unique characteristics, such as real-time constraints and resource limitations, which can make traditional software development and testing approaches difficult to apply. TDD is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing automated tests before writing code: the research in this thesis evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of using TDD for embedded systems development through a case study involving .... 
The results of the study indicate that TDD can be successfully applied to embedded systems development, and can lead to more robust and maintainable code. The thesis also provides insights into the challenges that must be overcome when using TDD for embedded systems development and suggests best practices for addressing those challenges.
