DynaMOSA, Dynamic Many-Objective Sorting Algorithm [1] is an approach that focuses on ..., and has been developed as an evolution 
of MOSA. This latter solution implements a many-objective GA to tackle test case generation.

DynaMOSA has been employed with Java classes.

Traditionally, with evolutionary search-based approaches, the algorithm is applied multiple times, 
once for each coverage criterion; doing so may 
Ultimately, however, the effectiveness of the solution depends on the problem
