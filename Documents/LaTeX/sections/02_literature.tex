DynaMOSA, Dynamic Many-Objective Sorting Algorithm [1] is an approach that focuses on ..., and has been developed as an evolution os MOSA.
This latter solution is focused on

DynaMOSA has been employed with Java classes.

Traditionally, with evolutionary search-based approaches, the algorithm is applied multiple times, 
once for each coverage criterion; doing so may 
Ultimately, however, the effectiveness of the solution depends on the problem
