\subsection{Introduction}
General introduction on what SDL is and why it is needed in the first place

\subsection{The waterfall model}
Start with the introduction of the waterfall model with a focus on its limitations (i.e. lack of feedback from the client, no possibility to revision requirements, etc...)


\subsection{Agile techniques}
Extreme programming, CI/CD, DevOps, ...


\subsection{Test Driven Development}
Comparison with other agile methods




\section{Testing embedded systems}
\subsection{Introduction}
Embedded Systems (ES) are a combination of hardware components and software systems that seamlessly work together to achieve a specific purpose. Such systems can be programmed or have a fixed functionality set. 
Today evrywhere, spanning from the agricultural field, to the medical and energy ones, employ ES of various size and complexity to achieve a domain-specific, often critical, goal .


Furthermore, given the absence of a user interface in most cases, testing such systems can be particularly challenging, given the lack of immediate feedback.
Usually, the testing process of ES follows the X-in-the-loop paradigm.
Reference the old survey papers (i.e. X in the loop) that provide a summary of the main techniques
