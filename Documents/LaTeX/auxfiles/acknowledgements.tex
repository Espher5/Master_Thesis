\chapter*{Acknowledgements}


"I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to my parents, who have always supported and encouraged me throughout my academic journey. Their unwavering love and belief in me have been a constant source of motivation.

I am also grateful to my sister for always being there for me and for providing a listening ear whenever I needed one. Your presence in my life has made a significant impact and I cannot thank you enough.

Lastly, I want to thank my nieces for reminding me to always find joy and laughter in life. Your infectious energy and positive spirit have brought so much light into my life and helped me through some of the toughest moments during my thesis journey.

To all of you, thank you for being a part of my life and for your love and support. This achievement would not have been possible without you."
